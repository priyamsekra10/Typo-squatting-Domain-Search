# Typo-squatting-Domain-Search
Developed a project to protect users from typo squatting threats by searching for registered domains that are similar or closely related to the user's domain. The system alerts users to potential risks, helping them identify and avoid malicious websites that may attempt to deceive or compromise their online presence.
